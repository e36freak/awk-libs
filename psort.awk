## usage: psort(s, d, patts, max [, how])
## sorts the values of the array "s", based on the rules below. creates a new
## sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers starting with 1. "patts"
## is a compact (*non-sparse) 1-indexed array containing regular expressions.
## "max" is the length of the "patts" array. returns the length of the "d"
## array. valid values for "how" are explained below. uses the quicksort
## algorithm, with a random pivot to avoid worst-case behavior on already sorted
## arrays. requires the __pcompare() and __pquicksort() functions.
##
##  Sorting rules:
##  - When sorting, values matching an expression in the "patts" array will
##    take priority over any other values
##  - Each expression in the "patts" array will have priority in ascending
##    order by index. "patts[1]" will have priority over "patts[2]" and
##    "patts[3]", etc
##  - Values both matching the same regex will be compared as usual
##  - All non-matching values will be compared as usual
##
## valid values for "how" are:
##   "std asc"
##     use awk's standard rules for comparison, ascending. this is the default
##   "std desc"
##     use awk's standard rules for comparison, descending.
##   "str asc"
##     force comparison as strings, ascending.
##   "str desc"
##     force comparison as strings, descending.
##   "num asc"
##     force a numeric comparison, ascending.
##   "num desc"
##     force a numeric comparison, descending.
