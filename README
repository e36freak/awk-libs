AWK library function descriptions

Every function below is fully POSIX compliant, and has been tested on gawk 3
and 4, as well as nawk 20110810 and mawk 1.3.4. Interval notation has not been
used in this library, even though POSIX states that it should be supported,
as most of the current implementations still do not support it.

Note: mawk 1.3.3 is even less POSIX compliant than 1.3.4, and doesn't handle
POSIX character classes in regexes (like [:space:] or [:alpha:]), among other
things. It is currently the standard on ubuntu, and is most likely standard on
other debian-based linux distributions, as well. The functions below are not
guaranteed to work on versions of mawk prior to 1.3.4, although they should not
be too difficult to alter in order to do so.

If you are using gawk, I recommend adding the location of this repo to the
AWKPATH environment variable. This will allow you to only supply the file name
to -f and @include, instead of having to supply the actual path to the library.


The 'examples' directory includes a sample script for each library, with sample
usage of each function. While most of the examples are solely there to give
examples, the "cfold" script is fully functioning and is (in my opinion) rather
useful. It shows just how powerful these libraries can be... most of the script
is just there to parse options. These examples are written with gawk extensions.
Making them POSIX is left as an exercise to the user, if desired.


Most of the functions in this library work by themselves, with the exception of
the functions in sort.awk and the max() and min() functions in strings.awk.
This means that they can easily be copy/pasted into a script, and will function
fine on their own. In the case of sort.awk, the functions that the others depend
on begin with '__', and which functions they go with (as well as which functions
require what) are explained in the comments.




Libraries, and the available functions within:

math.awk

  abs(number)
    returns the absolute value of "number"

  ceil(number)
    returns "number" rounded UP to the nearest int

  ceiling(multiple, number)
    returns "number" rounded UP to the nearest multiple of "multiple". integers
    only

  floor(multiple, number)
    returns "number" rounded DOWN to the nearest multiple of "multiple".
    integers only

  round(multiple, number)
    returns "number" rounded to the nearest multiple of "multiple". integers
    only

  rint(number)
    returns "number" rounded to the nearest integer

  change_base(number, start_base, end_base)
    converts "number" from "start_base" to "end_base"
    bases must be between 2 and 64. the digits greater than 9 are represented
    by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.
    if ibase is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may
    be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35. integers
    only. returns 0 if any argument is invalid

  format_num(number)
    adds commas to "number" to make it more readable. for example,
    format_num(1000) will return "1,000", and format_num(123456.7890) will
    return "123,456.7890". also trims leading zeroes
    returns 0 if "number" is not a valid number

  str_to_num(string)
    examines "string", and returns its numeric value. if "string" begins with a
    leading 0, assumes that "string" is an octal number. if "string" begins with
    a leading "0x" or "0X", assumes that "string" is a hexadecimal number.
    otherwise, decimal is assumed.

  isint(string)
    returns 1 if "string" is a valid integer, otherwise 0

  isnum(string)
    returns 1 if "string" is a valid number, otherwise 0

  isprime(number)
    returns 1 if "number" is a prime number, otherwise 0. "number" must be a
    positive integer

  gcd(a, b)
    returns the greatest common denominator (greatest common factor) of a and b.
    both a and b must be positive integers. uses the recursive euclid algorithm.

  lcm(a, b)
    returns the least common multiple of a and b. both a and b must be positive
    integers.

  calc_e()
    approximates e by calculating the sumation from k=0 to k=50 of 1/k!
    returns 10 decimal places

  calc_pi()
    returns pi, with an accuracy of 10 decimal places

  calc_tau()
    returns tau, with an accuracy of 10 decimal places
    http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto

  deg_to_rad(degrees)
    converts degrees to radians

  rad_to_deg(radians)
    converts radians to degrees

  tan(expr)
    returns the tangent of expr, which is in radians

  csc(expr)
    returns the cosecant of expr, which is in radians

  sec(expr)
    returns the secant of expr, which is in radians

  cot(expr)
    returns the cotangent of expr, which is in radians



sys.awk

  isatty(fd)
    Checks if "fd" is open on a tty. Returns 1 if so, 0 if not, and -1 if an
    error occurs

  mktemp(template [, type])
    creates a temporary file or directory, safely, and returns its name.
    if template is not a pathname, the file will be created in ENVIRON["TMPDIR"]
    if set, otherwise /tmp. the last six characters of template must be "XXXXXX",
    and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique. type, if
    supplied, is either "f", "d", or "u": for file, directory, or dry run (just
    returns the name, doesn't create a file), respectively. If template is not
    provided, uses "tmp.XXXXXX". Files are created u+rw, and directories u+rwx,
    minus umask restrictions. returns -1 if an error occurs.



strings.awk

  center(string [, width])
    returns "string" centered based on "width". if "width" is not provided (or 
    is 0), uses the width of the terminal, or 80 if standard output is not open
    on a terminal.
    note: does not check the length of the string. if it's wider than the
    terminal, it will not center lines other than the first. for best results,
    combine with fold() (see the "cfold" script in the "examples" directory for
    a script that does exactly this!)

  delete_arr(array)
    deletes every element in "array"

  fold(string, sep [, width])
    returns "string", wrapped, with lines broken on "sep" to "width" columns.
    "sep" is a list of characters to break at, similar to IFS in a POSIX shell.
    if "sep" is empty, wraps at exactly "width" characters. if "width" is not
    provided (or is 0), uses the width of the terminal, or 80 if standard output
    is not open on a terminal.
    note: currently, tabs are squeezed to a single space. this will be fixed

  shell_esc(string)
    returns the string escaped so that it can be used in a shell command

  ssub(ere, repl [, in])
    behaves like sub, except returns the result and doesn't modify "in".
    note: 'ere' must not use /.../ literal regex quoting

  sgsub(ere, repl [, in])
    behaves like gsub, except returns the result and doesn't modify "in".
    note: 'ere' must not use /.../ literal regex quoting

  lsub(str, repl [, in])
    substites the string "repl" in place of the first instance of "str" in the
    string "in" and returns the result. does not modify the original string. if
    "in" is not provided, uses $0

  glsub(str, repl [, in])
    behaves like lsub, except it replaces all occurances of "str"
    note: does not work in mawk when 'str' is empty

  str_to_arr(string, array)
    converts string to an array, one char per element, 1-indexed
    returns the array length

  extract_range(string, start, stop)
    extracts fields "start" through "stop" from "string", based on FS, with the
    original field separators intact. returns the extracted fields.

  fwidths(width_spec [, string])
    extracts substrings from "string" according to "width_spec" from left to
    right and assigns them to $1, $2, etc. also assigns the NF variable. if
    "string" is not supplied, uses $0. "width_spec" is a space separated list of
    numbers that specify field widths, just like GNU awk's FIELDWIDTHS variable.
    if there is data left over after the last width_spec, adds it to a final
    field. returns the value for NF.

  fwidths_arr(width_spec, array [, string])
    the behavior is the same as that of fwidths(), except that the values are
    assigned to "array", indexed with sequential integers starting with 1.
    returns the length. everything else is described in fwidths() above.

  lsplit(str, arr, sep)
    splits the string "str" into array elements "arr[1]", "arr[2]", .., "arr[n]",
    and returns "n". all elements of "arr" are deleted before the split is
    performed. the separation is done on the literal string "sep".

  ssplit(str, arr, seps [, ere])
    similar to GNU awk 4's "seps" functionality for split(). splits the string
    "str" into the array "arr" and the separators array "seps" on the regular
    expression "ere", and returns the number of fields. the value of "seps[i]"
    is the separator that appeared in front of "arr[i+1]". if "ere" is omitted or
    empty, FS is used instead. if "ere" is a single space, leading whitespace in
    "str" will go into the extra array element "seps[0]" and trailing whitespace
    will go into the extra array element "seps[len]", where "len" is the return
    value.
    note: /regex/ style quoting cannot be used for "ere".

  ends_with(string, substring)
    returns 1 if "strings" ends with "substring", otherwise 0

  trim(string)
    returns "string" with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed

  rev(string)
    returns "string" backwards

  max(array [, how ])
    returns the maximum value in "array", 0 if the array is empty, or -1 if an
    error occurs. the optional string "how" controls the comparison mode.
    requires the __mcompare() function.
    valid values for "how" are:
      "std"
        use awk's standard rules for comparison. this is the default
      "str"
        force comparison as strings
      "num"
        force a numeric comparison

  maxi(array [, how ])
    the behavior is the same as that of max(), except that the array indices are
    used, not the array values. everything else is explained in max() above.

  min(array [, how ])
    the behavior is the same as that of max(), except that the minimum value is
    returned instead of the maximum. everything else is explained in max() above.

  mini(array [, how ])
    the behavior is the same as that of min(), except that the array indices are
    used instead of the array values. everything else is explained in min() and
    max() above.



msort.awk

  msort(s, d [, how])
    sorts the elements in the array "s" using awk's normal rules for comparing
    values, creating a new sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers
    starting with 1. returns the length, or -1 if an error occurs.. leaves the
    indices of the source array "s" unchanged. the optional string "how" controls
    the direction and the comparison mode. uses the merge sort algorithm, with an
    insertion sort when the list size gets small enough. this is not a stable
    sort. requires the __compare() and __mergesort() functions.
    valid values for "how" are:
      "std asc"
        use awk's standard rules for comparison, ascending. this is the default
      "std desc"
        use awk's standard rules for comparison, descending.
      "str asc"
        force comparison as strings, ascending.
      "str desc"
        force comparison as strings, descending.

        force a numeric comparison, ascending.
      "num desc"
        force a numeric comparison, descending.

  imsort(s [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of msort(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in msort() above.

  msorti(s, d [, how])
    the behavior is the same as that of msort(), except that the array indices
    are used for sorting, not the array values. when done, the new array is
    indexed numerically, and the values are those of the original indices.
    everything else is described in msort() above.

  imsorti(s [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of msorti(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in msort() and msorti()
    above.

  msortv(s, d [, how])
    sorts the indices in the array "s" based on the values, creating a new
    sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers starting with 1, and the
    values the indices of "s". returns the length, or -1 if an error occurs.
    leaves the source array "s" unchanged. the optional string "how" controls
    the direction and the comparison mode. uses the merge sort algorithm, with
    an insertion sort when the list size gets small enough. this is not a stable
    sort. requires the __compare() and __mergesortv() functions. valid values for
    "how" are explained in the msort() function above.



qsort.awk

  qsort(s, d [, how])
    sorts the elements in the array "s" using awk's normal rules for comparing
    values, creating a new sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers
    starting with 1. returns the length, or -1 if an error occurs.. leaves the
    indices of the source array "s" unchanged. the optional string "how" controls
    the direction and the comparison mode. uses the quick sort algorithm, with a
    random pivot to avoid worst-case behavior on already sorted arrays. this is
    not a stable sort. requires the __compare() and __quicksort() functions.
    valid values for "how" are:
      "std asc"
        use awk's standard rules for comparison, ascending. this is the default
      "std desc"
        use awk's standard rules for comparison, descending.

  iqsort(s [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of qsort(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in qsort() above.

  qsorti(s, d [, how])
    the behavior is the same as that of qsort(), except that the array indices
    are used for sorting, not the array values. when done, the new array is
    indexed numerically, and the values are those of the original indices.

  iqsorti(s [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of qsorti(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in qsort() and qsorti()
    above.

  qsortv(s, d [, how])
    sorts the indices in the array "s" based on the values, creating a new
    sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers starting with 1, and the
    values the indices of "s". returns the length, or -1 if an error occurs.
    leaves the source array "s" unchanged. the optional string "how" controls
    the direction and the comparison mode. uses the quicksort algorithm, with a
    random pivot to avoid worst-case behavior on already sorted arrays. this is
    not a stable sort. requires the __compare() and __vquicksort() functions.
    valid values for "how" are explained in the qsort() function above.



psort.awk

  psort(s, d, patts, max [, how])
    sorts the values of the array "s", based on the rules below. creates a new
    sorted array "d" indexed with sequential integers starting with 1. "patts"
    is a compact (*non-sparse) 1-indexed array containing regular expressions.
    "max" is the length of the "patts" array. returns the length of the "d"
    array. valid values for "how" are explained below. uses the quicksort
    algorithm, with a random pivot to avoid worst-case behavior on already sorted
    arrays. requires the __pcompare() and __pquicksort() functions.
     Sorting rules:
     - When sorting, values matching an expression in the "patts" array will
       take priority over any other values
     - Each expression in the "patts" array will have priority in ascending
       order by index. "patts[1]" will have priority over "patts[2]" and

  ipsort(s, patts, max [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of psort(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in psort() above.

  psorti(s, d, patts, max [, how])
    the behavior is the same as that of psort(), except that the array indices
    are used for sorting, not the array values. when done, the new array is
    indexed numerically, and the values are those of the original indices.
    everything else is described in psort() above.

  ipsorti(s, patts, max [, how])
    the bevavior is the same as that of psorti(), except that the array "s" is
    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is described in psort() and psorti()
    above.



shuf.awk

  shuf(s, d)
    shuffles the array "s", creating a new shuffled array "d" indexed with
    sequential integers starting with one. returns the length, or -1 if an error
    occurs. leaves the indices of the source array "s" unchanged. uses the knuth-
    fisher-yates algorithm. requires the __shuffle() function.

  ishuf(s)
    the behavior is the same as that of shuf(), except the array "s" is sorted
    in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with sequential
    integers. everything else is described in shuf() above.

  shufi(s, d)
    the bevavior is the same as that of shuf(), except that the array indices

    sorted in-place. the original indices are destroyed and replaced with
    sequential integers. everything else is describmed in shuf() and shufi()
    above.



csv.awk

  create_line(array, max [, sep [, qualifier [, quote_type] ] ])
    Generates an output line in quoted CSV format, from the contents of "array"
    "array" is expected to be an indexed array (1-indexed). "max" is the highest
    index to be used. "sep", if provided, is the field separator. If it is more
    than one character, the first character in the string is used. By default,
    it is a comma. "qualifier", if provided, is the quote character. Like "sep",
    it is one character. The default value is `"'. "quote_type", if provided, is
    used to determine how the output fields are quoted. Valid values are given
    below. For example, the array: a[1]="foo"; a[2]="bar,quux"; a[3]="blah\"baz"
    when called with create_line(a, 3), will return: "foo","bar,quux","blah""baz"
    note: expects a non-sparse array. empty or unset values will become
    empty fields
    Valid values for "quote_type":
      "t": Quote all strings, do not quote numbers. This is the default
      "a": Quote all fields
      "m": Only quote fields with commas or quote characters in them

  qsplit(string, array [, sep [, qualifier] ])
    a version of split() designed for CSV-like data. splits "string" on "sep"
    (,) if not provided, into array[1], array[2], ... array[n]. returns "n", or
    "-1 * n" if the line is incomplete (it has an uneven number of quotes). both
    "sep" and "qualifier" will use the first character in the provided string.
    uses "qualifier" (" if not provided) and ignores "sep" within quoted fields.
    doubled qualifiers are considered escaped, and a single qualifier character
    is used in its place. for example, foo,"bar,baz""blah",quux will be split as
    such: array[1] = "foo"; array[2] = "bar,baz\"blah"; array[3] = "quux";



options.awk

  getopts(optstring [, longopt_array ])
    parses options, and deletes them from ARGV. "optstring" is of the form
    "ab:c". each letter is a possible option. if the letter is followed by a
    colon (:), then the option requires an argument. if an argument is not
    provided, or an invalid option is given, getopts will print the appropriate
    error message and return "?". returns each option as it's read, and -1 when
    no options are left. "optind" will be set to the index of the next
    non-option argument when finished.  "optarg" will be set to the option's
    argument, when provided. if not provided, "optarg" will be empty. "optname"
    will be set to the current option, as provided. getopts will delete each
    option and argument that it successfully reads, so awk will be able to treat
    whatever's left as filenames/assignments, as usual. if provided,
    "longopt_array" is the name of an associative array that maps long options
    to the appropriate short option. (do not include the hyphens on either).
    sample usage can be found in the examples dir, with gawk extensions, or in
    the ogrep script for a POSIX example: https://github.com/e36freak/ogrep



times.awk

  month_to_num(month)
    converts human readable month to the decimal representation
    returns the number, -1 if the month doesn't exist

  day_to_num(day)
    converts human readable day to the decimal representation
    returns the number, -1 if the day doesn't exist
    like date +%w, sunday is 0

  hr_to_sec(timestamp)
    converts HH:MM:SS to seconds, returns -1 if invalid format

  sec_to_hr(seconds)
    converts seconds to HH:MM:SS

  ms_to_hr(milliseconds)
    converts milliseconds to a "time(1)"-similar human readable format, such
    as 1m4.356s

  add_day_suff(day_of_month)
    prepends the appropriate suffix to "day_of_month". for example,
    add_day_suff(1) will return "1st", and add_day_suff(22) will return "22nd"
    returns -1 if "day_of_month" is not a positive integer



colors.awk
  set_cols(array)
    sets the following values in "array" with tput. printing them will format
    any text afterwards. colors and formats are:
      bold - bold text (can be combined with a color)
      black - black text
      red - red text
      green - green text
      yellow - yellow text
      blue - blue text
      magenta - magenta text
      cyan - cyan text
      white - white text
      reset - resets to default settings
