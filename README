AWK library function descriptions

POSIX compliant functions are marked with a "*" (and have been tested on
gawk 3 and 4, as well as nawk 20110810). Functions marked with "**" have also
been tested on mawk 1.3.4, which is not fully POSIX compliant. The markings next
to the library name indicate the lowest level of compliance of all of the
functions within. Interval notation has not been used in the functions in this
library, even though POSIX states that they should be supported, because most
current implementations of awk still do not support them.

Note: mawk 1.3.3 is even less so than 1.3.4, and doesn't handle POSIX character
classes in regexes, among other things. It is currently the standard on ubuntu,
and probably other debian-based linux distributions. Even functions marked with
'**' are not guaranteed to work on older versions of mawk, although they should
not be too hard to alter in order to do so.

I recommend adding the location of this repo to the AWKPATH environment
variable (if you're using gawk), so using -f and gawk's @include doesn't
require the actual path to the library.

The 'examples' directory includes a sample script for each library, with sample
usage of each function. The examples are written with gawk extensions.


Libraries, and the available functions within:


math.awk **

  ceil(multiple, number) **
    returns "number" rounded UP to the nearest multiple of "multiple". integers
    only

  floor(multiple, number) **
    returns "number" rounded DOWN to the nearest multiple of "multiple".
    integers only

  round(multiple, number) **
    returns "number" rounded to the nearest multiple of "multiple". integers
    only

  change_base(number, start_base, end_base) **
    converts "number" from "start_base" to "end_base"
    bases must be between 2 and 64. the digits greater than 9 are represented
    by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.
    if ibase is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may
    be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35. integers
    only. returns 0 if any argument is invalid

  calc_e() **
    approximates e by calculating the sumation from k=0 to k=50 of 1/k!
    returns 10 decimal places

  calc_pi() **
    returns pi, with an accuracy of 10 decimal places

  calc_tau() **
    returns tau, with an accuracy of 10 decimal places

  deg_to_rad(degrees) **
    converts degrees to radians

  rad_to_deg(radians) **
    converts radians to degrees

  tan(expr) **
    returns the tangent of expr, which is in radians

  csc(expr) **
    returns the cosecant of expr, which is in radians

  sec(expr) **
    returns the secant of expr, which is in radians

  cot(expr) **
    returns the cotangent of expr, which is in radians



strings.awk *

  center(string) **
    returns "string" centered based on terminal width, when stdout is a
    terminal. otherwise, assumes an 80 col width when centering.

  shell_escape(string) **
    returns the string escaped so that it can be used in a shell command

  ssub(ere, repl [, in]) **
    behaves like sub, except returns the result and doesn't modify "in".
    note: 'ere' must not use /.../ literal regex quoting

  sgsub(ere, repl [, in]) **
    behaves like gsub, except returns the result and doesn't modify "in".
    note: 'ere' must not use /.../ literal regex quoting

  lsub(str, repl [, in]) **
    substites the string "repl" in place of the first instance of "str" in the
    string "in" and returns the result. does not modify the original string. if
    "in" is not provided, uses $0

  glsub(str, repl [, in]) **
    behaves like lsub, except it replaces all occurances of "str"
    note: does not work in mawk when 'str' is empty

  str_to_arr(string, array) *
    converts string to an array, one char per element, 1-indexed
    returns the array length

  trim(string) **
    returns "string" with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed

  rev(string) *
    returns "string" backwards



csv.awk *

  create_line(array, max [, sep [, qualifier] ]) **
    Generates an output line in quoted CSV format, from the contents of "array"
    "array" is expected to be an indexed array (1-indexed). "max" is the highest
    index to be used. "sep", if provided, is the field separator. If it is more
    than one character, the first character in the string is used. By default,
    it is a comma. "qualifier", if provided, is the quote character. Like "sep",
    it is one character. The default value is `"'. For example, the array:
    a[1]="foo"; a[2]="bar,quux"; a[3]="blah\"baz", when called with
    create_line(a, 3), will return: "foo","bar,quux","blah""baz".
    note: expects a non-sparse array. empty or unset values will become
    empty fields

  qsplit(string, array [, sep [, qualifier] ]) *
    a version of split() designed for CSV-like data. splits "string" on "sep"
    (,) if not provided, into array[1], array[2], ... array[n]. returns "n".
    both "sep" and "qualifier" will use the first character in the provided
    string. uses "qualifier" (" if not provided) and ignores "sep" within
    quoted fields. doubled qualifiers are considered escaped, and a single 
    qualifier character is used in its place.
    for example, foo,"bar,baz""blah",quux will be split as such:
    array[1] = "foo"; array[2] = "bar,baz\"blah"; array[3] = "quux";



options.awk **

  getopts(optstring [, longopt_array ]) **
    parses options, and deletes them from ARGV. "optstring" is of the form
    "ab:c". each letter is a possible option. if the letter is followed by a
    colon (:), then the option requires an argument. if an argument is not
    provided, or an invalid option is given, getopts will print the appropriate
    error message and return "?". returns each option as it's read, and -1 when
    no options are left. "optind" will be set to the index of the next
    non-option argument when finished.  "optarg" will be set to the option's
    argument, if provided. if not provided, "optarg" will be empty.  getopts
    will delete each option and argument that it successfully reads, so awk will
    be able to treat whatever's left as filenames/assignments, as usual. if
    provided, "longopt_array" is the name of an associative array that maps long
    options to the appropriate short option. (do not include the hyphens on
    either).
    sample usage can be found in the examples dir, with gawk extensions, or in
    the ogrep script for a POSIX example: https://github.com/e36freak/ogrep



times.awk **

  month_to_num(month) **
    converts human readable month to the decimal representation
    returns the number, -1 if the month doesn't exist

  day_to_num(day) **
    converts human readable day to the decimal representation
    returns the number, -1 if the day doesn't exist

  hr_to_sec(timestamp) **
    converts HH:MM:SS to seconds, returns -1 if invalid format

  sec_to_hr(seconds) **
    converts seconds to HH:MM:SS
