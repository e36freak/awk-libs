## usage: create_line(array, max [, sep [, qualifier [, quote_type] ] ])
## Generates an output line in quoted CSV format, from the contents of "array"
## "array" is expected to be an indexed array (1-indexed). "max" is the highest
## index to be used. "sep", if provided, is the field separator. If it is more
## than one character, the first character in the string is used. By default,
## it is a comma. "qualifier", if provided, is the quote character. Like "sep",
## it is one character. The default value is `"'. "quote_type", if provided, is
## used to determine how the output fields are quoted. Valid values are given
## below. For example, the array: a[1]="foo"; a[2]="bar,quux"; a[3]="blah\"baz"
## when called with create_line(a, 3), will return: "foo","bar,quux","blah""baz"
## note: expects a non-sparse array. empty or unset values will become
## empty fields
## Valid values for "quote_type":
##   "t": Quote all strings, do not quote numbers. This is the default
##   "a": Quote all fields
##   "m": Only quote fields with commas or quote characters in them

## usage: qsplit(string, array [, sep [, qualifier] ])
## a version of split() designed for CSV-like data. splits "string" on "sep"
## (,) if not provided, into array[1], array[2], ... array[n]. returns "n", or
## "-1 * n" if the line is incomplete (it has an uneven number of quotes). both
## "sep" and "qualifier" will use the first character in the provided string.
## uses "qualifier" (" if not provided) and ignores "sep" within quoted fields.
## doubled qualifiers are considered escaped, and a single qualifier character
## is used in its place. for example, foo,"bar,baz""blah",quux will be split as
## such: array[1] = "foo"; array[2] = "bar,baz\"blah"; array[3] = "quux";
